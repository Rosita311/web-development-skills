            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I haven't made a lot of projects yet. But i'll explain my experience working with computers. I have always loved working with computers, writing and beining online in the early days of the internet. But when I was a younger I choose to become a social worker. When I was in my third year of college, everything went wrong. It's a long story, you can read it <a href="https://www.rulesbyrosita.nl/ik-stop-ermee/" target="_blank">here</a>. Anyway it al comes down to my cerebral palsy, wich is some kind of brain injury, not only I have some physical limitations, my brain is like a slow working computer harddisk. That doesn't mean I am mentally challenged, I am able to study well. After being in the rehabilitationcenter, I can't become a social worker, and I started blogging on my own website.</p>

                <p>Two and a half years ago, i started with a free account, learning to code at Codecademy. First I learned HTML, then CSS and then Javascript. Javascript was hard. But I got a chance to visit a company who builds costum WordPress-websites. I liked that so much and wanted to become a webdeveloper. I purchased a pro membership at Codecademy and started the skillpath how to build a website. Tomorrow I will reach my streak of 50 days on Codecademy. Currently I am working on the Tea Cozy Project.</p>
